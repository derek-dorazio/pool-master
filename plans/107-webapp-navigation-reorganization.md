# Plan 107 — Webapp Navigation Reorganization

## Purpose

Reorganize PoolMaster webapp navigation and page structure away from overgrown multi-tile "dashboard" pages toward smaller, single-purpose pages with clear MY vs LEAGUE scoping and a coherent commissioner admin surface. This plan is the handoff artifact for the Fran frontend developer persona (and any other agents touching these surfaces).

## Governing Principles (from memory)

Consult these feedback memories before touching nav or page layout:

- **Single-purpose pages** — default one page = one purpose, one save boundary, one or at most two tightly related containers. Multiple tiles are OK only when all tiles serve one concern grouped for scan-ability (e.g. Entries page = one tile per active contest — same concern, grouped).
- **MY vs LEAGUE scope** — inside a league, MY = the signed-in user's own team/entries/history (editable); LEAGUE = whole-league surfaces (mostly read-only for members).
- **No My Leagues page** — the league dropdown is the switcher. Landing is **Teams and Owners** at `/league/:leagueCode`.
- **Team is the league-facing entity; User is personal-facing** — league UI is team-centric; no "Members" page at league level.
- **List → Home with authority-gated editing** — list pages link to one canonical Home page per entity; Home toggles edit vs read-only UI via an authority hook (e.g. `useTeamAuthority(teamId)`), not via separate routes.
- **Daily-use vs commissioner admin** — daily-use surfaces (Team Home, Contest Home, lists) use authority-on-same-page; complex admin (Create Contest wizard, Manage Contest edit form) lives on its own commissioner-only pages inline in the LEAGUE menu.

## Consolidated Site Map

Every route in the reorganized webapp, flat. Authority column indicates who sees the route or its contents — in-page authority gating (e.g. commissioner-only sections on League Home) is *not* expressed here; see the detailed sections below for that.

### Pre-auth / invite flows

| Route | Page | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Auth home (login/register) | Unauthenticated |
| `/invite/:inviteCode` | Join league flow | Any (auth optional) |
| `/team-invite/:inviteCode` | Join team-owner flow | Any (auth optional) |
| `/join/:inviteCode` | Legacy redirect → `/invite/:inviteCode` | Any |

### Global (authenticated)

| Route | Page | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| `/welcome` | Zero-league fallback | Regular users with 0 leagues (transitional/defensive — not a main-journey destination) |
| `/users/:userId` | Canonical **User page** (authority-gated modals) | All authenticated |
| `/my-account` *(alias)* | Redirect → `/users/:myId` | All authenticated |
| `/profile`, `/preferences`, `/password`, `/account` *(aliases)* | Redirect → `/users/:myId` | All authenticated |

### League scope (inside `/league/:leagueCode/*`)

| Route | Page | Visibility / Menu source |
|---|---|---|
| `/league/:leagueCode` | **League Home** (authority-gated) | all — League ▾ landing |
| `/league/:leagueCode/teams` | **Teams and Owners** | all — League ▾ |
| `/league/:leagueCode/teams/:teamId` | **Team Home** (authority-gated) | all — row click from Teams and Owners; My Team ▾ resolves to signed-in user's teamId |
| `/league/:leagueCode/entries` | **My Entries** | self — My Team ▾ |
| `/league/:leagueCode/history` | **My Contest History** *(placeholder)* | self — My Team ▾ |
| `/league/:leagueCode/contests` | **League Contests** list | all — League ▾ |
| `/league/:leagueCode/contests/:contestId` *(canonical; today `/contests/:contestId` still exists)* | **Contest Home** (state-transitioning) | all — row click from League Contests. During migration, keep `/contests/:contestId` only as a temporary compatibility redirect to this canonical route; remove the legacy route in the final cleanup slice. |
| `/contests/:contestId/entries/:entryId` | **Entry page** (authority-gated) | entry owner when unlocked — edit icon from My Entries; redirect target for self-click on Contest Home pre-event |
| `/league/:leagueCode/contests/new` | **Create Contest** wizard | commissioner — League ▾ |
| `/league/:leagueCode/contests/manage` | **Manage Contests** list | commissioner — League ▾ |
| `/league/:leagueCode/contests/:contestId/manage` | **Manage Contest** per-contest edit | commissioner — row click from Manage Contests |

### Root admin (`/manage/*`) — see Plan 108 for details

| Route | Page | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| `/manage` | Hub (six section links) | Root admin |
| `/manage/leagues` | Leagues search + link | Root admin |
| `/manage/teams` | Teams search + link | Root admin |
| `/manage/users` | Users search + link | Root admin |
| `/manage/content-configuration` | Content Configuration list | Root admin |
| `/manage/content-configuration/:templateKey` | Template edit | Root admin |
| `/manage/sync` | Sync dashboard | Root admin |
| `/manage/sync/run-sport-sync` | Run Sport Sync | Root admin |
| `/manage/sync/run-event-sync` | Run Event Sync | Root admin |
| `/manage/sync-config` | Sync Configuration list | Root admin |
| `/manage/sync-config/poll-intervals` | Poll Intervals edit | Root admin |
| `/manage/sync-config/ingestion-schedule` | Ingestion Schedule edit | Root admin |
| `/manage/sync-config/sport-overrides` | Sport Overrides edit | Root admin |

### Post-auth landing resolution

| Condition | Destination |
|---|---|
| `isRootAdmin` | `/manage` (Plan 106 Slice A) |
| Regular user, has recent-league cookie (still a valid membership) | `/league/:leagueCode` (League Home) |
| Regular user, no recent-league cookie, `leagues.length > 0` | `/league/:mostRecentlyCreatedCode` (League Home) |
| Regular user, `leagues.length === 0` | `/welcome` — transitional/defensive only; regular users should always have ≥1 league (see invariant in `feedback_team_is_league_facing_entity.md`) |

### Deleted / collapsed routes

| Former route | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `/my-leagues` | League switcher dropdown in header; deleted |
| `/my-account`, `/profile`, `/preferences`, `/password`, `/account` *(as distinct pages)* | `/users/:myId` with authority-gated modals |
| `/league/:leagueCode/team` (old singular "my team") | `/league/:leagueCode/teams/:myTeamId` (canonical team URL) |
| `LeagueDetailPage` at `/league/:leagueCode` (old, multi-tile) | Split: League Home (landing) + Teams and Owners (child route) + per-section commissioner flows |

## Top Nav Scaffold (inside a league)

```
[League Switcher ▾]   My Team ▾   League ▾   [Account ▾]
```

Clicking a group label navigates to that group's landing page. Hover/secondary interaction reveals the full sub-item list.

### My Team ▾ (landing: My Team page)

| Item | Visibility | Route (proposed) | Page Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **My Team** | all (authority-gated edit) | `/league/:leagueCode/teams/:teamId` (user's team resolved at the link) | Team info + owners — editable for team owners + commissioners; read-only for others |
| **Entries** | all | `/league/:leagueCode/entries` | Tiles per active contest; each tile shows contest name + list of your entries + **Create Entry** button + edit icon per row |
| **History** | all | `/league/:leagueCode/history` | Placeholder for now; future design = grid with client-side sort/filter grouped year/sport/contest |

### League ▾ (landing: League Home at `/league/:leagueCode`)

| Item | Visibility | Route | Page Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **League Home** | all (authority-gated edit) | `/league/:leagueCode` | Canonical league page. Members: read-only identity + overview + "Leave league." When the league is inactive, members see a page-level banner "This league is not currently active." (Future: "Message commissioner" CTA attached to that banner — deferred until the messaging/notification system exists.) Commissioners: inline edit for league name/description/icon, join code display + regenerate, email invite flow, activate/inactivate. Root admin: same as commissioner, plus a root-admin-gated delete section when league is inactive. |
| **Teams and Owners** | all | `/league/:leagueCode/teams` | Table: linked Team Name / Icon / Owners (active owners + pending invite rows). Read-only — actions happen on Team Home. Current first-pass contract does not expose a separate team-code field, so the linked team name is the identifier until that contract exists. |
| **League Contests** | all | `/league/:leagueCode/contests` | List of open contests; each row → Contest Home |
| **Create Contest** | commissioner only | `/league/:leagueCode/contests/new` (exists) | Wizard owning immutable structural decisions (sport, event type, etc.) |
| **Manage Contests** | commissioner only | `/league/:leagueCode/contests/manage` → per-contest `/league/:leagueCode/contests/:contestId/manage` (exists) | List of contests → small edit form per contest for mutable `ContestConfiguration` subset. Route-ordering note: declare the specific `/contests/manage` list route before the dynamic `/contests/:contestId` route so React Router matches correctly. |

**League Settings is not a separate menu item** — its former contents (league identity, join code, activate/inactivate) are absorbed into League Home, gated by `useLeagueAuthority`. This mirrors the Team Home pattern exactly and gives root admins a single canonical page per league (reached from `/manage/leagues`) rather than a view page + edit page split.

### Per-entity Home pages (reached via list rows or directly)

| Entity | URL (canonical) | Authority model |
|---|---|---|
| League Home | `/league/:leagueCode` | `useLeagueAuthority` → `commissioner \| member`; commissioner edits identity/settings/lifecycle; member read-only. Root admin collapses into `commissioner` on any league. Root-admin-only delete section gated by `useIsRootAdmin()` + inactive status. |
| Team Home | `/league/:leagueCode/teams/:teamId` | `useTeamAuthority` → `owner \| commissioner \| viewer`; owner/commissioner edit, viewer read-only. Root admin collapses into `commissioner`. Root-admin-only delete section gated by `useIsRootAdmin()` + inactive status. |
| **User page** | `/users/:userId` | Backend-emitted `viewerAuthority` per request → `self \| commissioner \| root-admin \| viewer`. Action buttons launch focused modals; set visible depends on authority. See Authority matrix below. |
| Contest Home | `/league/:leagueCode/contests/:contestId` (canonical; old `/contests/:contestId` may temporarily redirect during migration) | Pre-event: entries list (name + team only). **Self rows are clickable and navigate to My Team ▾ Entries** (nav shortcut to own management page). Other rows are not clickable for anyone (including commissioners/root admin) — competitive-integrity rule. Post-event: becomes leaderboard with per-entry expand/modal |
| Entry page | `/contests/:contestId/entries/:entryId` (exists) | Editable only by entry owner when unlocked; read-only otherwise |

### User page authority matrix

`/users/:userId` is a single canonical page with authority-gated action modals. Backend enforces the authority rules; frontend reads `viewerAuthority` (or equivalent capability signal) from the response and renders the matching modal set. Multiple authorities may apply simultaneously (e.g. a root admin who's also a commissioner in a league sees both sets).

| Action (modal) | Self | Commissioner (of this user's league) | Root admin | Viewer (default) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Edit Profile | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Edit Preferences | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Change Password | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Inactivate Account (platform, reversible) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | — |
| Delete Account (platform, locked until inactive) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | — |
| Promote to Commissioner (role in this league) | — | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Demote to Member (role in this league) | — | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Remove from League (league membership only) | — | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Toggle Root Admin | — | ❌ | ✅ | — |
| Reset Password (admin-initiated) | — | ❌ | ✅ | — |

Commissioner never touches account-level state (inactivate/delete). Only self and root admin do.

**Discovery paths to `/users/:userId`:**
- From "My Profile" in the Account dropdown → `/users/:myId` (self authority)
- From Teams and Owners page → owner names are clickable → `/users/:ownerUserId`
- From Team Home Owners section → owner names are clickable → `/users/:ownerUserId`
- From `/manage/users` → row click → `/users/:userId` (root-admin authority)

### Account dropdown (global, top-right)

Collapsed flat list: **My Profile · Manage** *(root admin only)* **· Log out**

| Item | Route | Page Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| My Profile | `/users/:myId` | Canonical User page with authority-gated modal set. Self sees Edit Profile / Edit Preferences / Change Password / Inactivate Account / Delete Account as modals. |
| Manage | `/manage` (exists) | Root-admin hub (see Plan 108) |

Old routes `/my-account`, `/profile`, `/preferences`, `/password`, `/account` are no longer separate — all redirect/alias to `/users/:myId` for deep links.

## Tile → Destination Mapping

Each row maps an existing tile/section in the current codebase to its new home. "DELETE" = tile is orphan and goes away. "BUILD NEW" = the new nav requires a tile that doesn't exist yet.

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/leagues/league-detail-page.tsx`

This page is being dissolved — its current multi-tile content is split across the new
canonical **League Home** at `/league/:leagueCode` and **Teams and Owners** at
`/league/:leagueCode/teams`.

| Tile | Source lines | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| League Header & Summary | 532–576 | **League Home** — identity + status + counts. Commissioner-editable fields (name, description, icon) inline on the same page via authority hook. |
| Members list (with promote/demote/remove actions) | 579–682 | DELETE — commissioner/root-admin member-role actions move to `/users/:userId` in the later canonical User-page slice; League Home no longer owns roster role management. |
| My Team link card | 684–701 | DELETE — users reach team via My Team ▾ nav or Teams and Owners row link |
| Teams (browse all) link card | 703–718 | DELETE — users reach via League ▾ → Teams and Owners |
| Membership Actions (Leave league) | 721–755 | **League Home** — member-visible section. Resolves former OPEN QUESTION §2. |
| Commissioner Invitations (link + email invite) | 767–856 | **League Home** — commissioner-gated join code + email invite section. Resolves former OPEN QUESTION §3. |
| Contests (active) | 858–1007 | SPLIT: contest list → **League Contests**; per-user entries → **My Team ▾ Entries**; Create Entry → **Entries** tile action |
| Completed Contest History | 1009–1063 | SPLIT: contest rows → **League Contests** (post-event = leaderboard); user's entry rows → **My Team ▾ History** (placeholder for now) |

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/leagues/my-leagues-page.tsx`

Entire page is being deleted — league switcher dropdown is the only switcher.

| Tile | Source lines | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| League Directory Header | 214–223 | DELETE |
| League Cards grid (with Manage modal) | 225–311 | DELETE — content already on `welcome-page.tsx`; the "Manage league" modal is out of scope for this plan, audit separately if still in use |
| Review Focus placeholder text | 313–323 | DELETE |

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/leagues/leagues-page.tsx` — `WelcomePage` export

Remains as the zero-league landing (`/welcome`). The file has three render states:

| State | Lines | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Loading / Error | 42–66 | KEEP — honest states |
| Zero-league welcome + Create-first-league CTA | 68–106 | KEEP — this is `/welcome` under the new nav |
| Auto-redirect to default league | 108–111 | KEEP — enforces the post-auth recent-league landing rule |
| Has-leagues + no-default-resolved fallback (grid of league cards + "Open league" links) | 113–167 | **DELETE** — contradicts the "league switcher dropdown is the only switcher" rule. Harden `resolveDefaultLeagueCode` so it always returns a league code when the user has ≥1 membership, making this branch unreachable. Remove the unreachable code. |

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/leagues/leagues-page.tsx` — `MyLeaguesPage` export

`MyLeaguesPage` lives in the same file as `WelcomePage`. Its tiles are already marked DELETE below. The export and route (`/my-leagues`) should be removed entirely once the new landing behavior is live.

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/teams/teams-page.tsx`

This page becomes (or is replaced by) **Teams and Owners** at `/league/:leagueCode`.

| Tile | Source lines | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| Page Header (back-link, my-team link) | 260–288 | REDUCE — remove navigation helpers; keep only page title |
| Pending Owner Invites | 290–340 | SPLIT: per-team pending-invites list → **Team Home** Owners section (already partially present at `my-team-page.tsx:916–1108`; confirm/extend with email + status icon + Cancel/Resend/Nudge actions gated to owner+commissioner authority). Read-only aggregated display → **Teams and Owners** Owners column (shows pending invite email + status icon as a row entry alongside active owners). No standalone "Pending Invites" tile. |
| Joined Teams list (current: full member list per team) | 342–410 | **Teams and Owners** — BUT reduced to spec columns: linked Name / Icon / Owners. Current squad-list contract does not expose a separate team code, so the first pass uses the linked team name as the canonical identifier. *MISMATCH §5: current tile expands each row with full active-member list; new spec hides members — users see the full team only by clicking through to Team Home* |

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/teams/my-team-page.tsx`

This page becomes **Team Home** — canonical single-page for any team (authority-gated).

| Tile | Source lines | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| Team Header (name/icon/role/description) | 527–554 | STAY on Team Home |
| Team Details & Icon Selection (edit name + icon, save) | 567–654 | STAY on Team Home — authority-gated editable |
| Active Contest Entries (contest tiles + entries + Create Entry + rename) | 657–832 | MOVE to **My Team ▾ Entries** page. Team Home no longer carries entries; Entries page is the single source for entry management |
| Historical Contest Entries | 834–914 | MOVE to **My Team ▾ History** page (placeholder for now; data still fetches even if presentation is minimal) |
| Active Team Members (owners list, invite co-owner, replace owner, remove owner, revoke invites) | 916–1108 | STAY on Team Home — Owners section, authority-gated. Active owners + pending invites both shown here. Owner/commissioner sees the full management UI (invite co-owner, replace, remove, cancel/resend/nudge pending invites, inactivate team). Viewer sees a read-only list showing active owner names and pending invite rows (email + status icon, no actions). Owner names are clickable links to `/users/:ownerUserId` for all authority tiers. |
| Team Lifecycle (inactivate team) | 1110–1128 | STAY on Team Home — owner-gated destructive action with its own warning UX |

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/contests/contest-detail-page.tsx`

This page becomes **Contest Home** — pre-event entries list; post-event leaderboard.

| Tile | Source lines | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| Contest Header & Navigation (manage link, back) | 652–687 | STAY on Contest Home; "Manage contest" link gated to commissioner, routes to Manage Contest page |
| Contest Rules & Snapshot (immutable config display) | 690–710 | STAY on Contest Home (read-only, pre + post event) |
| Your Team Entries (list + create + rename + entry metadata) | 712–940 | MOVE to **My Team ▾ Entries** page. Contest Home no longer carries "Your" entries — it only shows the aggregate all-entries list |
| All Entries (leaderboard) | 944–1063 | STAY on Contest Home. Pre-event: self rows remain clickable but redirect to **My Team ▾ Entries** instead of the Entry detail page (nav shortcut; no info leak). Non-self rows are not clickable for anyone pre-event. BUILD NEW §B: post-event expand/modal for participant detail does not exist yet. |

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/contests/create-contest-page.tsx`

STAY as **Create Contest** wizard (commissioner-only). No route/page movement. Wizard is a single unified form with mode-conditional sections (tiered vs category), not discrete sequential steps.

**Internal refactor candidate (not blocking):** the tier editor grid at lines 1369–1464 conflates a read-only tier summary with the advanced editor by disabling inputs when `showAdvanced=false`. Consider a future pass that renders a read-only tier list when `!showAdvanced` and swaps in the full editor when `showAdvanced`. Low priority; current UX is acceptable.

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/contests/contest-entry-page.tsx`

STAY as the canonical **Entry page** (`/contests/:contestId/entries/:entryId`). No route/page movement. Authority: editable by entry owner when unlocked; read-only otherwise.

**Tiles on this page** (all stay in place):

| Tile | Source lines | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Page header + navigation | 640–675 | Phase badge, back links |
| Progress metrics grid (Tier progress, Picks saved, Tiebreaker, Lock time) | 677–718 | Read-only context |
| Entry details tile (metadata + owner-edit form when self+editable) | 723–837 | **Internal refactor note:** mixes always-read-only metadata (6-cell grid) with entry-owner edit controls. Guards separate concerns correctly, but a future pass could split metadata (always-visible) from edit form (self+editable only) into distinct visual containers. Not blocking. |
| Selection progress summary | 839–889 | Read-only per-group completion |
| Lineup builder (editable tier panels when unlocked; `LockedSelectionGroup` read-only tables otherwise) | 892–994 | Reuses `SelectionParticipantCard` (142–206) and `LockedSelectionGroup` (209–273) components. Well-organized. |

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/leagues/manage-league-modal.tsx`

The modal trigger point is already gone with the deleted `MyLeaguesPage`, and its contents now decompose into inline commissioner-authority sections on League Home. Physical file cleanup can happen in the later orphan-route/component cleanup slice once the remaining dead tests are removed.

| Current tab / section | Source lines | Destination on League Home (commissioner authority) |
|---|---|---|
| Overview sidebar (name/code/role/status/icon preview) | 296–311 | Merge into League Home page header (read-only identity band visible to everyone; replaces the need for a separate sidebar) |
| **Details tab — edit form** (name, description) | 336–455 *(edit fields only)* | **League identity panel** — editable name + description + Save |
| **Details tab — read-only metrics** (member count, active contests, status, created, code, homepage link) | 336–455 *(read-only fields)* | **League metrics panel** — separate from the edit form (split recommended by audit to avoid mixing edit and read-only on one tile) |
| **Icon tab** | 458–540 | **League branding panel** — icon selector + Save |
| **Settings tab** (join policy display, placeholder for future) | 543–564 | **League settings panel** — join policy read-only display; future expansion deferred |
| **Lifecycle tab — Inactivate section** | 576–621 | **League lifecycle — Inactivate/Reactivate** section (commissioner-authority) |
| **Lifecycle tab — Delete section** | 623–703 | **League lifecycle — Delete** section (root-admin-authority; appears only when `isRootAdmin && league.status === 'INACTIVE'`, per the Plan 108 Section 1 pattern) |

Component/file cleanup is deferred to the later orphan-route/component cleanup slice after the inline League Home panels are fully settled.

### `clients/poolmaster/src/features/account/my-account-page.tsx`

This page is being replaced by the canonical **User page** at `/users/:userId`. When self-viewing, the page displays read-only identity summary and action buttons that launch focused modals. Each current tile maps to one self-authority modal on the new page.

| Current tile | Source lines | New destination (modal on `/users/:myId`) |
|---|---|---|
| Account Summary (read-only identity fields) | 483–529 | Inline on the User page (identity band, not behind a modal — always visible for self) |
| Profile (first/last name edit) | 531–601 | **Edit Profile modal** |
| Preferences (timezone/locale/time/date format) | 603–712 | **Edit Preferences modal** |
| Password (current/new/confirm) | 714–811 | **Change Password modal** |
| Account availability (activate/inactivate) | 826–879 | **Inactivate Account / Reactivate Account modal** |
| Delete account (with confirmation wizard) | 881–997 | **Delete Account modal** (locked until inactive) |

## New Tiles / Pages Required (BUILD NEW)

These are called out by the new nav but don't exist in the code yet:

- **A. My Team ▾ Entries page** — consolidates "per-contest entries for this user" logic currently split between `my-team-page.tsx` (lines 657–832) and `contest-detail-page.tsx` (lines 712–940). One page, tile per active contest, each tile contains entries list + Create Entry button + edit icon.
- **B. Contest Home post-event leaderboard expand/modal** — current All Entries tile (`contest-detail-page.tsx:944–1063`) is a flat list. Post-event UX requires per-row expand or modal revealing participant selections.
- **C. Contest Home pre-event: disable click-through** — the current "Open entry" links on All Entries (for the current user only) must be removed/hidden pre-event per the competitive-integrity rule.
- **C1. Contest Home route migration + cleanup** — add the canonical `/league/:leagueCode/contests/:contestId` route, keep old `/contests/:contestId` only as a temporary compatibility redirect during migration, update touched navigation/tests to the canonical route, then remove the legacy route in the final cleanup slice. Do not leave permanent dual-route support behind.
- **D. League Home page** — new canonical page at `/league/:leagueCode` (replaces today's `LeagueDetailPage` content, which is being dissolved). Authority-gated via `useLeagueAuthority`: members see identity + status + overview + Leave league. When league is inactive, members see the "This league is not currently active" banner (future: Message commissioner CTA). Commissioners additionally see inline League details (name + description, editable + Save), League branding (icon selector + Save), Commissioner invitations (join-link regeneration + invite by email), and League lifecycle (Inactivate). Root admin collapses into commissioner tier and additionally gets a root-admin-gated permanent-delete section when the league is inactive (mirrors Team Home pattern). Contest and completed-history cards remain on League Home temporarily as truthful fallback sections until their dedicated routes land later in the plan. This page *replaces* both the previously planned separate League Settings page **and** the old `ManageLeagueModal` interaction.
- **E. Manage Contests list page** — new list page under League ▾ (commissioner-only). Rows link to the existing `/contests/:contestId/manage` page.
- **F. My Team ▾ History placeholder page** — new route, minimal page. Detailed design deferred (see Open Questions §7).
- **G. User page** `/users/:userId` — canonical page with authority-gated action modals. Replaces `/my-account` and the previously-planned decomposed `/profile`, `/preferences`, `/password`, `/account` pages. Reached from My Profile (Account dropdown, self), from Teams and Owners / Team Home (owner-name click, viewer or commissioner depending on context), and from `/manage/users` (root admin). Self-authority modal set: Edit Profile, Edit Preferences, Change Password, Inactivate Account, Delete Account (locked until inactive).
- **G1. `useUserAuthority(userId)` (or equivalent authority read)** — reads backend-emitted `viewerAuthority` signal from the user detail response. Frontend does not compute authority client-side; it displays the modal set that matches the backend authority signal.
- **G2. Commissioner action modals on `/users/:userId`** — Promote to Commissioner, Demote to Member, Remove from League. Visible when authority includes commissioner on the user's current-league context.
- **G3. Root-admin action modals on `/users/:userId`** — Toggle Root Admin, Reset Password, Inactivate Account, Delete Account. Visible when authority includes root admin. Replaces the Plan 108-era modals that were planned on `/manage/users` row actions.
- **G4. Clickable owner names** — a small shared "owner link" render component used on both the Teams and Owners table (Owners column) and the Team Home Owners section, routing to `/users/:ownerUserId`.
- **H. `useTeamAuthority(teamId)` hook** — returns `owner \| commissioner \| viewer`. Powers Team Home's authority gating. Root admin collapses into `commissioner` tier on any team. Replaces scattered inline `leagueQuery.data?.role === 'COMMISSIONER'` checks.
- **I. `useLeagueAuthority(leagueCode)` hook** — returns `commissioner \| member`. Powers League Home's authority gating. Root admin collapses into `commissioner` tier on any league. Also usable for commissioner-gated nav items (Create Contest, Manage Contests visibility).
- **J. `useIsRootAdmin()` hook** — fine-grained check for root-admin-only sections on League Home and Team Home (permanent delete).

## Orphan Tiles (DELETE)

- `league-detail-page.tsx:684–701` — My Team link card (users reach team via nav)
- `league-detail-page.tsx:703–718` — Teams link card (users reach via nav)
- `MyLeaguesPage` export in `leagues-page.tsx` (entire component) — content handled by `WelcomePage` zero-league state + the league switcher dropdown
- `WelcomePage` fallback branch at `leagues-page.tsx:113–167` — unreachable under the new default-landing rule
- Old `/my-account` route (replace with alias/redirect to `/users/:myId`; no decomposed sub-routes needed)
- Old `/my-leagues` route
- `clients/poolmaster/src/features/leagues/manage-league-modal.tsx` — entire file; contents decomposed into the League Home commissioner panels (see item D)
- Header hash anchors `#league-contests`, `#league-history` in `app-shell.tsx:203–268` — no longer valid once `/league/:leagueCode` becomes Teams and Owners; nav should point to proper routes instead

## Open Questions / Product Calls Needed

1. ~~Member promote/demote/remove~~ — **RESOLVED**: all three live as commissioner-authority modals on `/users/:userId` (Promote to Commissioner, Demote to Member, Remove from League). Commissioners reach a user via clickable owner names on Teams and Owners / Team Home. The old Members tile at `league-detail-page.tsx:579–682` is fully replaced by this flow and should be deleted.
2. ~~Leave league home~~ — **RESOLVED**: lives on League Home, member-visible section.
3. ~~Commissioner invitations scope~~ — **RESOLVED**: both the join link/code AND "Invite by email" live on League Home in a commissioner-gated section.
4. ~~Pending owner invites home~~ — **RESOLVED**: Team Home Owners section (primary, with Cancel/Resend/Nudge actions for owner+commissioner authority) + Teams and Owners Owners column (read-only aggregate with email + status icon). No standalone tile.
5. **Teams and Owners member-list detail** (`teams-page.tsx:342–410`) — current tile shows all active members inline per team; new spec is Owners-only column. Confirm that members (non-owners) are no longer surfaced at the league level, only at Team Home. **Confirm with product.**
6. ~~Contest Home pre-event click-through~~ — **RESOLVED**: pre-event, non-self rows are not clickable for anyone (including commissioners/root admin); self rows are clickable but navigate to **My Team ▾ Entries** (nav shortcut), not to the Entry detail page. Post-event: normal leaderboard with per-entry expand/modal.
7. **My Team ▾ History** — design deferred. When unblocked, pick layout (grid with sort/filter, grouped year/sport/contest/entry) and commit as a separate Beads issue.
8. ~~Entries page URL~~ — **RESOLVED**: `/league/:leagueCode/entries` (the My Team ▾ group implies "my"; matches the `/teams/:teamId` convention).
9. ~~League Contests URL~~ — **RESOLVED**: `/league/:leagueCode/contests`.
10. ~~Manage Contests list URL~~ — **RESOLVED**: `/league/:leagueCode/contests/manage` (list) → `/league/:leagueCode/contests/:contestId/manage` (per-contest edit, exists). Order specific routes before dynamic `:contestId` routes.
11. ~~"Message commissioner" CTA placement~~ — **RESOLVED**: scoped to League Home inactive-league state. Members see a page-level banner "This league is not currently active" when the league is inactive. The "Message commissioner" nudge CTA attaches to that banner and is deferred until the messaging/notification system exists. Not a general messaging feature.
12. ~~Post-auth default landing~~ — **RESOLVED**:
    - Regular user lands on `/league/:code` (League Home) — resolver order: recent-league cookie (if still valid membership) → otherwise most recently created league.
    - Root admin lands on `/manage` (existing Plan 106 Slice A).
    - `/welcome` zero-league state is a transitional/defensive fallback only — invariant: regular users must belong to ≥1 league (via invite / register-and-join / accepting invite); root admins are the sole exception.
    - Harden `resolveDefaultLeagueCode` so it always returns a code when `leagues.length > 0`; delete the unreachable fallback grid at `leagues-page.tsx:113–167` in the same slice.

## Backend / Contract Questions (route to Brad)

- **`ContestConfiguration` mutable vs immutable split** — the Manage Contest edit form renders only mutable fields; which subset is mutable post-creation? Exported generated type should make this explicit (either via field description, a separate `MutableContestConfiguration` shape, or an OpenAPI flag).
- **Per-contest entry limits** — the Entries page Create Entry button must disable at a contest's entry cap; surface the cap on the generated `Contest` or `ContestConfiguration` shape.
- **Entry creation route** — today we have `/contests/:contestId/entries/:entryId` for detail/edit. Creation flow (what route, what payload, what response) needs confirmation against the generated SDK before the Entries page ships.
- **Team authority** — confirm the current `league-detail` response carries enough information to compute `useTeamAuthority(teamId)` locally (owner team membership + league commissioner role). If not, a dedicated endpoint or field is needed.
- **User `viewerAuthority` signal** — the user detail endpoint (`getUser` or equivalent) must emit a `viewerAuthority` field (or a capabilities object) indicating what the current requester can do: `self`, `commissioner` (for which league), `root-admin`, `viewer`. Frontend reads this directly rather than computing authority locally. If the endpoint does not expose this today, request an additive field. Root-admin / commissioner gating of action endpoints must remain backend-enforced regardless.

## Bugs Consumed by This Plan

These open beads issues are directly relevant; resolving them is part of this reorg rather than parallel:

- `pool-master-dxd.1` — League selector shows leagues outside memberships (switcher is now the only switcher, so this must be tight)
- `pool-master-dxd.2` — League landing does not route to valid active league context (fully resolved by "landing = recent league's Teams and Owners" rule)
- `pool-master-dxd.3` — Invalid/unauthorized league route shows generic load error (Teams and Owners page must render honest access-state messages)
- `pool-master-dxd.4` — Accessible member league route fails with "We couldn't load this league" (depends on Teams and Owners implementation)

## Out of Scope for This Plan

- `/manage` root-admin hub IA — agreed sections (Leagues / Teams / Users / Content Configuration / Sync / Sync Templates) are captured in `feedback_manage_hub_structure.md` but the per-section tile mapping is a separate audit (next step).
- Mobile-specific nav patterns (hamburger menus, collapsed drawer, etc.) — the current header is flex-responsive; mobile IA is a follow-up concern once desktop scaffold is agreed.
- Visual design refinement (typography, iconography, spacing) — this plan is IA and page ownership only.

## Execution Phases (sketch)

Phase-level sequencing will get its own slicing once open questions §1–12 are answered and the `/manage` audit is complete. At that point each BUILD NEW item (A–I) should get its own Beads issue and be slotted into a sequenced execution plan.

## Action Plan

| ID | Phase | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 107-001 | 1 | Add route scaffold for canonical League Home, Teams and Owners, My Entries, My History, Manage Contests list, and canonical Contest Home migration path | Done | Added league-scope canonical path builders, honest scaffold pages for `entries`, `history`, `contests`, and `contests/manage`, a canonical team-home adapter route, and a temporary `/contests/:contestId` compatibility redirect into `/league/:leagueCode/contests/:contestId`. Validated with the full required repo gate set before closeout. |
| 107-002 | 1 | Rework post-auth landing and delete `/my-leagues` as a first-class destination | Done | Simplified `/welcome` to a zero-league fallback plus default-league redirect, converted `/my-leagues`, `/leagues`, and the top-level `/contests` entrypoint into compatibility redirects, and updated remaining in-app league-home links away from the deleted destination. Validated with the full required repo gate set before closeout. |
| 107-003 | 2 | Build Teams and Owners page from current teams-page tile content | Done | Reworked `/league/:leagueCode/teams` into the read-only Teams and Owners directory, removed the standalone pending-invites/manage affordances, linked team names directly to Team Home, and added owner-name links that resolve through a truthful temporary `/users/:userId` scaffold. Current squad-list contract does not expose a separate team-code field, so this first pass uses the linked team name as the identifier. Validated with the full required repo gate set before closeout. |
| 107-004 | 2 | Build League Home and dissolve `LeagueDetailPage` + `manage-league-modal` content into authority-gated panels | Done | Reworked League Home around inline commissioner/root-admin management panels, removed roster role-management from this page, kept member leave behavior and inactive-banner semantics on the canonical route, and retained contests/history as temporary fallback sections while later dedicated routes are still staged. Root-admin-only delete now lives on League Home for inactive leagues. Validated with the full required repo gate set before closeout. |
| 107-005 | 3 | Build canonical User page at `/users/:userId` with self-service modal set | Done | Moved self-service account actions onto the canonical `/users/:userId` route with dedicated profile, preferences, password, lifecycle, and delete dialogs; `/my-account` now redirects to `/users/:myId`; and non-self routes stay truthful placeholders until the additive cross-user detail/capabilities contract lands. Validated with the full required repo gate set before closeout. |
| 107-006 | 3 | Add commissioner and root-admin action modals to the User page | Not Started | Commissioner: promote/demote/remove from league. Root admin: toggle root admin, reset password, inactivate/delete account. |
| 107-007 | 4 | Build My Team Entries page and move entry-management affordances off Team Home and Contest Home | Not Started | Consolidates current split logic from Team Home and Contest Home into one page. |
| 107-008 | 4 | Complete Contest Home migration, pre-event click rules, and post-event leaderboard expansion behavior | Not Started | Includes canonical league-scoped route adoption, self-row redirect to My Entries, and post-event expand/modal build. |
| 107-009 | 5 | Build Manage Contests list page and wire commissioner League-menu navigation | Not Started | Per-contest manage page remains existing destination; ensure route ordering avoids `:contestId` collisions. |
| 107-010 | 5 | Add My Team History placeholder and finish orphan-route/component cleanup | Not Started | Remove stale hash anchors, deleted routes, and leftover page exports once replacements are live. |
| 107-011 | 6 | Run full validation, reconcile Beads, and close remaining plan drift | Not Started | Includes frontend, contract, and route cleanup verification for final merged IA. |
